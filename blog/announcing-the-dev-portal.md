Collab.Land is proud to announce the launch of its new Developer Portal and API product offering. These pivotal additions serve to broaden accessibility for developers, paving the way for further innovation within the comprehensive Collab.Land network of communities.

## Introducing the Developer Portal
The Developer Portal provides a dedicated platform for developers to contribute their Miniapps to:

* Create client applications and get access to API credentials
* Contribute Miniapps to the Collab.Land Marketplace. 
* Leverage LWC flow to request user permissions for data access.

This significant evolution enables developers to reach over 50,000 communities who are actively seeking to enhance their members' experiences. Through the dev portal, developers can build and submit miniapps https://7671234c.collabland-dev.pages.dev/docs/downstream-integrations/api/authentication#login-with-collabland-lwc---beta to provide to a vast array of applications and services for community admins to customize their communities.

## First Look at Collab.Land APIs

### Request user permissions for data access with LWC Flow

Leverage the Collab.Land LWC flow to request user permissions to access their data on Collab.Land. This will allow you to access user wallets and build custom experiences in your projects. The [LWC flow](/docs/downstream-integrations/api/authentication#login-with-collabland-lwc---beta) follows the OAuth2 protocol, allowing applications to obtain an access token that can be used to interact with the Collab.Land API on behalf of the authenticated user.

## Upholding Privacy and User Consent
Collab.Land remains committed to privacy and security. Accordingly, any use of the community APIs that involves member data will necessitate explicit user consent, reflecting best practices in data privacy and giving members complete control over their personal information.
