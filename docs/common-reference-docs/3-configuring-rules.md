# Configuring TGRs(Token Gating Rules)

TGRs are the rules that the wallet assets will be checked against by Collab.Land. The API will return `true/false` for each rule to indicate if the wallet address fulfils the defined rules or not. Here's a list of all the [supported chains and tokens on Collab.Land](https://collabland.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/70000641603-supported-chains-and-tokens-by-collab-land).

## Define Token Gating Rules

Token Gating Rules (TGRs) are schemas that describe the required tokens. They usually include information about the token such as `chain id`, `contract address`, `token types`, `metadata`, etc. The following is an example TGR that requires at least one NFT of contract address `0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d` on mainnet.

```json
"rules": [
    {
      "type": "ERC721",
      "chainId": 1,
      "minToken": "1",
      "contractAddress": "0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d",
      "roleId": "001"
    }
]
```

Collab.Land supports fungible and non-fungible tokens on many chains. See below for more information on the different properties that can be used to define different types of TGRs.

```json
{
  "account": "string",
  "rules": [
    {
      "chainId*": 0,
      "type*": "string",
      "contractAddress*": "string",
      "tokenId": "string",
      "minToken": "string",
      "maxToken": "string",
      "roleId": "string",
      "name": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "id": "string",
      "tokenSymbol": "string",
      "collectionName": "string",
      "classifierGroup": "string",
      "eventId": "string",
      "scheme": "string",
      "query": "string",
      "variables": {
        "_dummyFieldForGraphQL": "string",
        "additionalProp1": {}
      },
      "asset": "string",
      "requiresMetadata": true,
      "version": "string"
    }
  ],
  "callbackUrl": "string",
  "async": true
}
```

### Token Details Explained

To find the token details, please refer to this article [Find Token Details](./finding-token-details).

> (\*) indicates a required field.

**chainId\***: The chainID is a unique ID assigned to each chain(L1 and L2) - For example `1` is the chainID for Ethereum Mainnet while `137` is the chainID of Polygon Mainnet. You can find more chainIDs on [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/).

**type\***: Select the token type of your token. For example, for EVM based chains, it can be ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, etc. For non-EVM chains, it can be Solana, Flow, etc. If you are not sure about the token type, you can use the [Find Token Details](./finding-token-details) article to find the token type.

**contractAddress \***: The contract address of your token.

**tokenId (optional)**: For NFT token types such as `ERC-721` & `ERC-1155`, you can add specific token IDs.

> When using the ERC-1155 token type, you must enter the token IDs for all tokens in your collection in the token ID section. Token IDs should be separated by one comma, and no spaces. You can also input a range of token IDs, for example: 30-90.

**minToken (optional)**: The minimum amount of tokens that are required to qualify for the rule.

> If you do not enter a minimum amount of tokens, the default is 1.

**maxToken (optional)**: The maximum amount of tokens that are required to get the role.

> If you do not enter a maximum amount of tokens, the default is infinity.

**roleID (optional)**: The unique identifier for the rule. You can use this to identify the rule in the API response.

**Attributes (optional)**: For NFT token types such as ERC-721, you can add specific metadata conditions. For example, you can add a condition that the token must have a specific attribute or trait.

> You can find the metadata traits and attributes for your token by looking at the properties tab of the token on OpenSea or by using the [Find Token Details](./finding-token-details) article.

## Sample Request & Response

### Sample request

POST https://api.collab.land/access-control/check-roles

```json
{
  "account": "0x01c20350ad8f434bedf6ea901203ac4cf7bca295",
  "rules": [
    {
      "type": "ERC721",
      "chainId": 1,
      "minToken": "1",
      "contractAddress": "0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d",
      "roleId": "001"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Sample response

```json
{
  "roles": [
    {
      "id": "001",
      "granted": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### TGRs for Fungible Tokens

You can have TGRs for Fungible Tokens(ERC-20), for example `$USDC` on Ethereum Mainnet, the following example requires at least 1 $USDC token and at most 100 $USDC tokens to qualify for the role ID `001`.

```json
"rules": [
  {
      "roleId": "001",
      "chainId": 1,
      "minToken": "1",
      "maxToken": "100",
      "contractAddress": "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48",
      "type": "ERC20"
  }
]
```

You can also have TGRs for NFTs(ERC-721 & ERC-1155). In case of ERC-721 for example, the following example requires at least 1 NFT of contract address `0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d` on mainnet to qualify for the role ID `002`.

```json
"rules": [
  {
      "roleId": "002",
      "chainId": 1,
      "minToken": "1",
      "contractAddress": "0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d",
      "type": "ERC721"
  }
]
```

Here's a TGR example of a ERC-1155 token that requires at least 1 NFT of contract address `0x2953399124F0cBB46d2CbACD8A89cF0599974963` on Polygon Mainnet which has token ID `12382299798866046354843276329909118056248259593254812422227920898302362517754` to qualify for the role ID `003`.

```json
"rules": [
  {
      "name": "Stoned Dawgz WL Pass",
      "roleId": "003",
      "chainId": 137,
      "tokenId": "12382299798866046354843276329909118056248259593254812422227920898302362517754",
      "minToken": "1",
      "contractAddress": "0x2953399124F0cBB46d2CbACD8A89cF0599974963",
      "type": "ERC1155"
  }
]
```

For ERC-1155, since it requires entering each token ID, we also support OpenSea collections which are on Ethereum mainnet. For example, the following example requires at least 1 NFT of collection `conanscircle` on Ethereum Mainnet.

```json
"rules": [
  {
      "collectionName": "conanscircle",
      "name": "holder",
      "roleId": "004",
      "chainId": 1,
      "minToken": "1",
      "type": "OPEN_SEA"
  }
]
```

Other than EVM based chains, you can also have TGRs for other chains such as Solana and many others.

Here are some examples of TGRs for Solana:

```json
"rules": [
  {
      "tokenId": "2nPkG7zgW8Edr5eNhbaJ1RqNgx6Ds4ZsRM8qTRBNe2i1",
      "name": "Degen Whale",
      "roleId": "005",
      "chainId": 8000000000101,
      "minToken": "5",
      "contractAddress": "creators",
      "type": "SOLANA_NFT"
    }
]
```

```json
"rules": [
  {
    "name": "Okay Bear holder",
    "roleId": "006",
    "chainId": 8000000000101,
    "minToken": "1",
    "contractAddress": "CJk8TvAXcq1cvC85M9aMQCxPMkTCSuWN5HsFEgAjh4ut",
    "type": "SOLANA_FT"
  }
]
```
