## Connect Wallet
Clicking the Connect Wallet button will take you to you wallet connect UI page. Here it shows various providers from where you can connect the wallet.

Now this is a prerequisite that you must have a wallet created on one of these providers and ask Collab Land team to send you minimum amount of tokens to join the community (generally one token is enough).

For e.g. we select MetaMask as an option then it will ask to sign message to verify your wallet.

It opens up the MetaMask browser extension (one need this also as a prerequisite) and ask to sign the message.
