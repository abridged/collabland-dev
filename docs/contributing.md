```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
```

##### b. Using GitHub Desktop

- In GitHub Desktop, click on the "Branch" menu.
- Select "New Branch."
- Enter a branch name (e.g., feature/new-feature) and click "Create Branch."

### 5. Make Changes

Make the necessary changes or additions to the codebase. Whether you're fixing a bug, implementing a new feature, or improving documentation, ensure your changes align with the project's guidelines.

### 6. Commit Your Changes

Once your changes are complete, commit them with clear and concise messages. For example:

##### a. Using Command Line

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature: XYZ"
```

##### b. Using GitHub Desktop

- Open GitHub Desktop.
- Describe your changes in the "Summary" field.
- Click "Commit to <branch-name>".

### 7. Push Changes to Your Fork

##### a. Using Command Line

```bash
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

##### b. Using GitHub Desktop

- Click "Push origin" in the GitHub Desktop interface.

### 8. Create a Pull Request

### 9. Participate in Review

Collab.Land maintainers will review your pull request, providing feedback and suggestions. Be open to collaboration and address any requested changes.

### 10. Merge Your Changes
