[The `/access-control` endpoint](LINK NEEDED) allows client applications to interact with Collab.Land's token gating engine to verify a wallet address or crypto account with a list of rules based on the token ownership.

## Authentication

The endpoint requires an API key to be passed in as the `x-api-key` request header. The client application needs to be approved with `token-gating` scope by Collab.Land.

```
x-api-key: <api-key>
```

## Check roles synchronously

Check roles for an account against a list of token gating rules and get a response from the call for the roles to be assigned or removed.

### Trt it out
