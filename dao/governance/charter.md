This applies only to the distributions listed in a "qualified written  notices of allocation" as provided in the Internal Revenue Code (Section  1385(a)). If you receive distributions via a "non-qualified written notice of  allocation", you must include this money in your income tax return for the  year the Cooperative actually makes the payments to you.

The Initial Board shall have the authority to make all amendments to this Charter within the initial term (until the membership meeting of 2025) which are required to further the purposes of the DAO, provided that they do not remove the financial and governance rights of the Members in any way contrary to the law.

The notice of the special meeting must be given to those entitled to attend the meeting at least 48h in advance, and must state the subject of the meeting. Only matters that were stated in the notice can be discussed and voted on during a special meeting.  
    - 3.2.2.3.3. **Action without a meeting**. All actions of the Board may be  taken without a meeting if the action is agreed to in writing by all of the Stewards.
    - 3.2.2.3.4. **Waiver of notice**. Notices of Board meetings may be  waived by any or all of the Steward, and attending a meeting is considered as waiving notice.

    - 3.2.2.3.5. **Quorum**. The presence of ‚Öî of the Stewards will constitute  a quorum and the decisions of the Board will be approved by vote of the majority of the Stewards present and voting.

  - 3.2.2.4. **Agreements with Members**. The Board will have the power to  carry out all agreements of the DAO with its Members in every way advantageous to the Cooperative, representing the Members collectively.

    - 4.4.1.2.3. Unminted tokens are not in circulation.

Token holders who do not have voting rights (example, those who have not signed membership agreements) are not counted for the purpose of quorum.

  - 4.4.2.1. E.g. If we have 1,000 total tokens in circulation, then we‚Äôll need 100  tokens to vote to reach the quorum threshold.
  - 4.4.2.2. The DAO may change the default quorum threshold by vote.

- 4.4.3. The Quorum threshold is defined by the total number of tokens that have voted in a proposal.

  - 4.4.3.1. The DAO may create different types of proposals that require a higher or lower quorum threshold through the existing proposal process.

- 4.4.4. The Board is responsible for setting the process for proposals not explicitly defined in this Charter.
- 4.4.5. If two consecutive proposals fail due to not meeting quorum, the quorum requirement is halved.  

  - 4.4.5.1. Once a proposal passes, the previous quorum threshold is reinstated automatically.

## 5. Delegation

### 5.1. Delegation and Proxy Voting

- 5.1.1. Delegates are DAO Members who have been delegated voting power from another party‚Äôs governance tokens through an on-chain transaction. Delegation is otherwise known as proxy voting.
- 5.1.2. Only DAO Members in good standing may be Delegates.
- 5.1.3. Non-Members who hold the DAO‚Äôs governance token may only delegate  their token votes to a DAO Member in good standing. Tokens that have been delegated by non-members will not count towards quorum.

### 5.2. Delegation Removal

- 5.2.1. Delegators and/or Delegates may remove the delegation at any time for any reason. No delegation of votes may be permanent.

### 5.3. Ineligible for Delegation

## 6. Initial Token Distribution

### 6.1. Token Voting

### 6.2. Initial Mint

- 6.2.1. Upon the Effective Date of this Charter, the DAO will mint one billion  (1,000,000,000) $COLLAB governance tokens.

  - 6.2.1.1. These tokens currently have no intrinsic value other than  governance.

- 6.2.2. The DAO may not mint more tokens beyond the initial one billion.

## 7. Building the DAO Future

### 7.1. DAO Health Parameters

- 7.1.1. The DAO will measure health based on a set of parameters that are flexible to accommodate learning and incentive-based to encourage participation and propel Programs and growth.  
- 7.1.2. Health measurements will surely change as learning accelerates and membership expands.  
- 7.1.3. We cannot anticipate all problems, but the hope is that gaps in procedure will be filled through proposals.

### 7.2. DAO Health

- 7.2.1. Our goal is to align the DAO members to a shared set of objectives and  encourage participation in the activities to achieve key results. The Key  Performance Indicators (KPIs) are measurements we use to evaluate how  the DAO is performing over time.  
- 7.2.2. The baseline KPIs include financials, member engagement, and proposals.
- 7.2.3. The measurements will answer questions such as, how is the investment  portfolio performing, what percentage of proposals are contributing to deal flow, and how many members are actively participating in voting.  
- 7.2.4. The indicators will be measured real-time, monthly or seasonally and will  be accessible by all members.

### 7.3. Knowledge Sharing

- 7.3.1. To accelerate the world‚Äôs transition to equitable and just governance while  supporting our network of world-class founders, we must document our  stories and share them with the world.

## 8. Finances

### 8.1. **Taxes**: Members acknowledge and consent that they are responsible for reporting those patronage dividends on their personal tax returns and for paying any tax liability on those patronage dividends. This responsibility includes amounts allocated to a member‚Äôs Member Account but not paid out in cash.

### 8.2. **Allocating Income and Losses**:
Every year, we will figure out how much revenue the DAO made after all the expenses are subtracted and this is called "Net Income." We will do this calculation in the following way:

- 8.2.1. Gross Receipts. All revenue actually received by the DAO, from members  or non-members, resulting from normal operating activities of the DAO, as  well as any other resources except loans, grants, donations, and  investments, will be considered ‚ÄúGross Receipts.‚Äù 
- 8.2.2. Deductions from Gross Income. From the Gross Income, we will subtract the following items:

  - 8.2.2.1. Allowed costs and expenses: from the Gross Income, we will deduct  any lawful costs, expenses, and other charges needed to calculate how much revenue the DAO made (Net Income) for that year. 
  - 8.2.2.2. Revenue-based investor dividends: Any distributions that are owed  to investors according to the rules adopted by the DAO for the specific shares of stock or tokens, which would be based on the DAO‚Äôs Gross Revenue, other methods that don't use Net Income as basis (called "Revenue-based Dividends"). The DAO will count the amount of money distributed as Revenue-based Dividends when figuring out how much taxes it owes.
  - 8.2.2.3. Reserves. The Board can decide on how much money should be set aside for unexpected costs, such as bad debts, potential losses,  working capital, paying off debt, and buying back membership  equity (called "Reserves"). Unless the money is given to members who are entitled to a share of the DAO's Net Income, the DAO will add the money set aside in the Reserves when figuring out the  taxes it owes and the taxes will be subtracted from the Net Income. Members and others who are entitled to a share of the DAO's Net Income do not have any rights or claim to the Reserves at any time except when the organization is dissolved and the Reserves will be distributed according to the law and the rules of the organization (specifically set in 9.1).
  - 8.2.2.4. Contributions to Surplus. The Net Income, minus any taxes owed on it, made by the DAO from doing business with people who are not members and from sources that are not related to its members  (called ‚ÄúNon-Member Patronage‚Äù) can be kept by the DAO in a surplus fund. This fund can be used by the DAO as working capital, and for other purposes as determined by the Board and the DAO. However, the Member cannot access this fund or have any claim to it before the DAO is dissolved.  
  - 8.2.2.5. DAO‚Äôs Net Margins. The balance of the Gross Receipts that remains after all of the above deductions is the Cooperative‚Äôs Net Margins, which include the net margins of the Patron Members  entitled to participate in the distribution of the Net Margins of the Cooperative. Net Margins will be allocated, and distributed when appropriate, to the Members based on the Member‚Äôs Patronage  Activities and in proportion to the Patronage Activity of all Patron Members for that year.

- 8.2.3. Net Losses. Losses will be allocated in any manner the Board determines to be fair and equitable, considering the circumstances leading to the loss, subject to any provisions of Investor Member agreements with the DAO.
- 8.2.4. Patronage Dividends.  

  - 8.2.4.1. The Net Margins belong to the DAO and will be allocated and eventually distributed to the members who qualify, at least once a year. The way the money is given out will be based on how much business each member did with the cooperative, and the Board will decide when and how it will be allocated and distributed. The Board will decide how much of the Net Margins each member is entitled to based on how much business they did with the cooperative and how much revenue the DAO generated. The DAO will inform each member how much they will be allocated from the Net Margins within 8 and a half months after the end of the fiscal year. This will be in a written notice that also explains when the distributions will be made, and the taxable amounts.
  - 8.2.4.2. ‚ÄúPatronage Activity: refers to the total amount of services that the  DAOs members provided to or bought from or contributed to the DAO during a specific period of time. The Board will determine the DAO‚Äôs total patronage activity and each member's share of it. Each member's share of the DAO's profits and losses will be based on their share of the total patronage activity.  
  - 8.2.4.3. Allocation and distribution of Patronage Dividends may result in tax  implications. The DAO is not qualified to provide you with legal and tax advice, but will provide information about the methods it adopts, as requested by the Member or required by law.

- 8.2.5. Qualified and Nonqualified Allocations. These are legal forms by which the allocation of Patronage Dividends are made by the DAO to the Members. They follow specific legal requirements and have different legal or tax consequences. The determination of how the allocations will be made is made by the Board and to the extent that they impact you as a Member, you will be notified of those.
- 8.2.6. Qualified Notice of Allocation, Payment and Reinvestment. If the profits are distributed to the members via qualified notice of allocation, the Board will distribute at least 20% of the allocations to the members in cash and the remaining amounts may be credited to the member's account with the DAO for later redemption. This credit is considered a payment to the member and a re-investment by the member in the DAO.
- 8.2.7. Alternative Method of Payment. In addition, or as a replacement for traditional methods of payment and redemption of Patronage Dividends, the DAO may use digital assets, fungible or non-fungible, as determined by a policy of the DAO, for the payment of Patronage Distributions, which may be redeemed by the DAO in cash, cryptocurrency, goods, or services, and any combination of those.

### 8.3. Legal Limit on Payments to Members

- 8.3.1. The following applies to all payments to members because of their  membership, other than wages or salary. The DAO can make payments  (distributions) to members only out of the DAO‚Äôs cash that is legally available for distribution.
- 8.3.2. The DAO cannot legally make a distribution if, after making the distribution,  the DAO would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business, or if, after making the distribution, the sum of the value of DAO‚Äôs assets would be less than its total liabilities.

### 8.4. Member Accounting

- 8.4.1. Amounts that are allocated to a member but not paid out are recorded in  the member‚Äôs ‚ÄúMember Account,‚Äù which is a ledger for each member on the DAO‚Äôs books.
- 8.4.2. A Member Account reflects the member‚Äôs capital contribution, if any, plus  allocations of net earnings, minus distributions (pay-outs), minus losses. If any person is both a Patron Member and an Investor Member, the Member Account for each type of membership may be separate.
- 8.4.3. Membership Redemption. In case of termination of a Member (voluntarily or otherwise), the Member will only be entitled to payment of any allocated but undistributed Patronage Distributions that has been assigned to the Member. The Member will not be entitled to repayment of membership fees, if any were originally paid.  

## 9. Miscellaneous concerning termination of the DAO

### 9.1. Order of distribution of assets in the event of dissolution, liquidation, or sale of all (or substantially all) of the DAO‚Äôs assets:

- 9.1.1. If one of these events happen, the DAO will pay all of its debts and liabilities first, based on their respective priorities as defined by law or by agreement; then, any remaining asset will be distributed to the Members in the following order, proportionally:  
- 9.1.2. first, to the Investor Members, if any, according to the liquidation rights set in the designation of the preferred series;
- 9.1.3. Then to all Members, to the extent of any declared and allocated by undistributed patronage distributions.

- 9.1.4 If the proceeds are not enough to pay all members of a particular group of members listed above, then within such group for which proceeds are insufficient to fully pay the members of a particular group of members, then DAO will pay each member within the group in proportion to the amount the member would have received if there were enough funds.

### 9.2. Unclaimed Payments:

- 9.2.1. If the DAO attempts to make any payment to any member but the payment remains unclaimed for three years after notice to the member, the DAO will transfer the funds to the DAO‚Äôs treasury, general operating account, or undivided reserve. The notice to the member for this purpose may include written notice in any form of electronic communication regularly used by the DAO; however, it does not have to include a paper notice. The DAO will not be liable to  any Member who has not provided or refused to provide sufficient information to allow for direct notifications to the Member or the Member‚Äôs representative.

### 9.3. Merger, sale, consolidation, or equity capital exchange:

- 9.3.1. Except for the merger of a DAO subsidiary, as provided in 9.3.2 below, for  any plans involving a merger, sale of a majority of assets, consolidation,  dissolution, or exchange of capital, the Cooperative must first receive  approval from 75% of the Stewards on the Board. Then, 67% of the eligible  Members must also approve the plan, whether they vote in person,  virtually, or by mail, email, or other electronic means. Section 9.1 above will  be applied to any resulting proceeds from these plans.
- 9.3.2. The Board has the discretion to approve a plan for merging a subsidiary of  the DAO into the DAO by a 67% vote of the Members, without seeking further approval or consent, if the DAO holds 100% of voting units, memberships, or interests in the subsidiary and the right to vote on behalf of the subsidiary. However, if the merger would materially affect the voting  shares, memberships or other interests of the DAO‚Äôs members, then  members have the right to vote on the plan of merger according to the  provisions in 9.3.1 above.

## 10. Legal Agreements

### 10.1. **Governing law and jurisdiction**:

- 10.1.1 The DAO and its members agree to be governed  by the laws of the United States, and specifically the laws of the state of Colorado. 

### 10.2. **Conflict Resolution, litigation and Waiver of jury trial**:

- 10.2.1 If the DAO or the  members haven't chosen a system to solve conflicts, including on-chain, and if two  (or more) members or a member and the DAO have a problem that they can't solve by talking openly and honestly, using the conflict resolution processes adopted by  the DAO, then one of them can ask for mediation. A mediator will be chosen by  both sides or by the Board if they can't agree. If all these steps don't solve the conflict, then the Member who is not satisfied by the final decision of the DAO can  take the matter to court. This must be done in Colorado and the parties agree that they will only go to court in Denver, Colorado. The Members and the DAO agree, by entering into the membership relationship, that they cannot change the place  where they go to court. **Both members and the company agree to waive their right to a jury trial in any case related to these rules**.

### 10.3. **Notices**:

-10.3.1 Unless something different is said, all messages or information sent that  are required to be sent to Members according to this Charter must be sent electronically. They will be considered delivered if sent by during the DAO‚Äôs business hours and the notice is confirmed. If the notice does not need to be confirmed or is sent outside of business hours, it will be considered delivered the next business day. Notices will also be put up on the DAO's online platforms and will be considered delivered the day after they are published.

### 10.4. **Confidentiality**:

- 10.4.1 We agree to respect the confidentiality of the DAO and its members. The DAO will maintain the information it is legally required to maintain, either directly or through third-party data processors, and third-party ID service providers. The DAO will not share this information with members or other individuals or entities unless required by law.
