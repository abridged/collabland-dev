## How to Earn Money from Copy Trading

:::info

The Telefrens YouTube channel has a full [copy trading tutorial](https://youtu.be/PsWL21BReHc).

:::

Creators earn an affiliate fee from every trade executed using their copy trading link, amounting to half of the trading fees.

Here are the step-by-step directions for creating, sharing, and executing a copy trade using the Telefrens bot on Telegram.

### 1. Creator Creates a Copy Trade Link

1. Type `/copytrade` in DMs with the Telefrens bot or use the command from the Telefrens bot menu in Telegram DMs.

2. Click on "create copy trade link."

3. Select a token for trading. Telefrens uses [OKX DEX](https://www.okx.com/web3/build/docs/build-dapp/api-asset-get-all-coins) on the Arbitrum blockchain and only supports those tokens currently.

4. Decide whether to restrict the copy trade link to your Pass Holders only.
  
    - Skip this restriction if you want the link to be open to everyone.

5. Submit your copy trade.

### 2. Creator Shares the Copy Trade Link to Pass Holders

1. Copy the copy trade unique link.

2. Share this link with your contacts or in a group to enable others to copy trade the selected asset by opening the link.

### 3. Pass Holder Executes the Copy Trade

Start with the copy trade link received from a friend or a contact.

1. Open the link to view the token available for copy trading (e.g., $USDC).

2. Ensure you have sufficient funds in your Telefrens smart account. Telefrens trades ETH on Arbitrum.

:::tip

If you need to deposit funds, follow the [instructions provided](./intro#deposit-eth-to-your-smart-account-on-arbitrum-one) in the Telefrens interface. <!--Check out the [deposit tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmyt5i7JmBPd03r2eJ-EaMA) on YouTube.-->

:::

3. Enter the amount you wish to trade (e.g., 0.001 ETH) in the prepopulated app and set your slippage preference.

4. Confirm the transaction if the details meet your expectations.

    - You will receive a DM confirmation from the bot upon successful submission of the trade request.

    - Check the status of your trade either through the explorer link provided by the bot or in your Telefrens app smart account transaction history.
