## What is Telefrens?

Telefrens enables an individual or brand to create their own Telegram group with [Token Gated Access](/help-docs/key-features/token-gate-communities) automatically. It allows Creators to bootstrap and monetize their followings through the sale of blockchain-based Passes.

Holders can purchase Passes that unlock access to a Creator's exclusive group chat in Telegram.

Telefrens enables p2p communication and community formation within Telegram and groups benefit from Telegram's robust and feature-rich chat platform.

Telefrens leverages Collab.Land's `ERC4337` smart account implementation, the gmPASS.

:::tip

The [gmPASS](/help-docs/key-features/gm-pass) enables non-custodial, user-controlled, and secure blockchain interactions through a smart account wallet.

:::

### The Vision

The gmPASS will be tied into more and more functionality for Collab.Land as time goes on.

</details>

## The Details

### Bonding Curves

Passes are minted along a bonding curve, resulting in variable prices for Passes.

:::caution

Price slippage will occur if multiple accounts are buying and selling along the bonding curve at the same time.

:::

So, a crypto bonding curve is like a rollercoaster designed by a math nerd. It's this fancy graph that decides how much your Passes are worth. The twist? The more people buy in, the higher its price climbs. But remember, this isn't your grandma's savings bond. The curve can go up or down, making it as unpredictable as Vin Diesel doing standup.

#### Default Bonding Curve

Telefrens is launching with the default bonding curve from Friend.Tech.

$$
f(x)=\frac{x^2}{16000}
$$

Bonding curves will be customizable by Creators in a future update.

### Royalties Revenues + Protocol Share

Telefrens empowers Creators by ensuring they always receive royalties revenue on buys and sells of their Passes.

<!-- - 5% of buys/sells to Creators
- 5% to Collab.Land, split further
    - variable percentage as community incentives 0%-1%
        - points system, gamified leaderboard
    - remaining 4%-5% to Collab.Land Co-op-->

| 90%                 |                    |                                  | Bonding curve     |

  </div>

### Referral Points

Referral rewards will vary between a minimum of 0% and a maximum of 1% of trade value of Telefrens Passes.

The amount and distribution mechanics of community incentives will be adjusted by Collab.Land team. Governance over rewards will be decentralized to $COLLAB token holders at a later point in time.

When community incentives are at their maximum of 1% of trade revenues, the revenue share is depicted in the diagram below. All numerical values are percentages, i.e. 90 ‚û° 90% of the whole.

### Leaderboard

:::info

The Leaderboard tracks everyone's Telefrens referral points versus other claim participants.

:::
