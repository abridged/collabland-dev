TeleFrens is the better SocialFi app from the team that built Collab.Land.

## Welcome to the TeleFrens Docs

TeleFrens is currently in closed alpha. <!--Sign up for the waitlist to get access.-->

## What is TeleFrens

TeleFrens enables an individual or brand to create their own Telegram group with [Token Gated Access](/help-docs/key-features/token-gate-communities) automatically. It allows Creators to bootstrap and monetize their followings through the sale of blockchain-based Keys.

Holders can purchase Keys that unlock access to a Creator's exclusive group chat in Telegram.

Unlike Friend.Tech, TeleFrens enables p2p communication and community formation within Telegram; groups benefit from Telegram's robust and feature-rich chat platform.

TeleFrens leverages Collab.Land's `ERC4337` smart account implementation, the gmPASS.

The [gmPASS](/help-docs/key-features/gm-pass) enables non-custodial, user-controlled, and secure blockchain interactions.
