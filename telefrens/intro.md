TeleFrens is the better SocialFi app from the team that built Collab.Land.

## Welcome to the TeleFrens Docs

TeleFrens is currently in closed alpha. Sign up for the waitlist to get access.

## What is TeleFrens

TeleFrens enables an individual or brand to create their own Telegram group with Token Gated Access automatically. It allows Creators to bootstrap and monetize their followings through blockchain-based bonding curves.

Holders can purchase Keys that unlock access to a Creator's exclusive group chat in Telegram.

Unlike Friend.Tech, TeleFrens enables p2p communication and community formation within Telegram; groups benefit from Telegram's robust and feature-rich chat platform.

TeleFrens leverages Collab.Land's `ERC4337` smart acocunt implementation, the gmPASS.
