## What is Telefrens?

Telefrens enables an individual or brand to create their own Telegram group with [Token Gated Access](/help-docs/key-features/token-gate-communities) automatically. It allows Creators to bootstrap and monetize their followings through the sale of blockchain-based Passes.

Holders can purchase Passes that unlock access to a Creator's exclusive group chat in Telegram.

Telefrens enables p2p communication and community formation within Telegram; groups benefit from Telegram's robust and feature-rich chat platform.

Telefrens leverages Collab.Land's `ERC4337` smart account implementation, the gmPASS.

:::tip

The [gmPASS](/help-docs/key-features/gm-pass) enables non-custodial, user-controlled, and secure blockchain interactions.

:::

The gmPASS will be tied into more and more functionality for Collab.Land as time goes on. Open the Product Map below to view.

Community incentives and rewards will vary between a minimum of 0% and a maximum of 1% of trade value of Telefrens Passes.

The amount and distribution mechanics of community incentives will be adjusted by Collab.Land team. Governance over rewards will be decentralized to $COLLAB token holders at a later point in time.

When community incentives are at their maximum of 1% of trade revenues, the revenue share is depicted in the diagram below. All numerical values are percentages, i.e. 90 ➡ 90% of the whole.
