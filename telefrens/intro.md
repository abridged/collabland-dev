## What is Telefrens?

Telefrens enables an individual or brand to create their own Telegram group with [Token Gated Access](/help-docs/key-features/token-gate-communities) automatically. It allows Creators to bootstrap and monetize their followings through the sale of blockchain-based Passes.

Holders can purchase Passes that unlock access to a Creator's exclusive group chat in Telegram.

Telefrens enables p2p communication and community formation within Telegram; groups benefit from Telegram's robust and feature-rich chat platform.

Telefrens leverages Collab.Land's `ERC4337` smart account implementation, the gmPASS.

:::tip

The [gmPASS](/help-docs/key-features/gm-pass) enables non-custodial, user-controlled, and secure blockchain interactions.

:::

### The Vision

The gmPASS will be tied into more and more functionality for Collab.Land as time goes on.

## The Details

### Royalties Revenues + Protocol Share

Telefrens empowers Creators by ensuring they always receive royalties revenue on buys and sells of their Passes.

<!-- - 5% of buys/sells to Creators
- 5% to Collab.Land, split further
    - variable percentage as community incentives 0%-1%
        - points system, gamified leaderboard
    - remaining 4%-5% to Collab.Land Co-op-->

|---------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| 90%                 |                    |                                  | Bonding curve     |

  </div>

### Referral Points

Referral rewards will vary between a minimum of 0% and a maximum of 1% of trade value of Telefrens Passes.

The amount and distribution mechanics of community incentives will be adjusted by Collab.Land team. Governance over rewards will be decentralized to $COLLAB token holders at a later point in time.

When community incentives are at their maximum of 1% of trade revenues, the revenue share is depicted in the diagram below. All numerical values are percentages, i.e. 90 ➡ 90% of the whole.

### Leaderboard

:::info

The Leaderboard tracks everyone's Telefrens referral points versus other claim participants.

:::

Referrers can claim referral rewards at the end of each claim period. Rewards are proportional to an individual's Leaderboard rank, i.e. higher rank == more rewards.

Everyone can see their ranking on the Leaderboard using `/leaderboard` command with the Telefrens bot in Telegram.

### Points Formula

The Points formula will be adjusted at the discretion of the Collab.Land team. The initial Community Points formula is:

1. +1 Point when a user you invite onboards to Telefrens
2. +1000 Points when a user you invite does a transaction using Telefrens

<!-- - {ONLY IN TWA INITIALLY}
