## How to Earn Money from Trade Links

:::info

The Telefrens YouTube channel has a full [trade links tutorial](https://youtu.be/ciReb5j8Go0).

:::

Creators earn an affiliate fee from every trade executed using their trade link, amounting to half of the trading fees.

Here are the step-by-step directions for creating, sharing, and executing a trade link using the Telefrens bot on Telegram.

### 1. Creator Creates a Trade Link

1. Type `/tradelink` in DMs with the Telefrens bot or use the command from the Telefrens bot menu in Telegram DMs.

2. Click on "create trade link".

3. Select a token for trading. Telefrens uses [OKX DEX](https://www.okx.com/web3/build/docs/build-dapp/api-asset-get-all-coins) on the Arbitrum blockchain and only supports those tokens currently.

4. Decide whether to restrict the trade link to your Pass Holders only.
  
    - Skip this restriction if you want the link to be open to everyone.

5. Submit your trade link.

### 2. Creator Shares the Trade Link to Others

1. Copy the unique trade link.

2. Share this link with your contacts or in a group to enable others to trade the selected asset by opening the link.

### 3. Pass Holder Executes the Trade Link

:::info

Watch [this demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UR8TTZM2u9I) to see Trade Links in action.

Creators can share the video with their followers or create their own tutorials.

:::

Start with the trade link received from a friend or a contact.

1. Open the link to view the token available for trading (e.g., $USDC).

2. Ensure you have sufficient funds in your Telefrens smart account. Telefrens trades ETH on Arbitrum.

:::tip

If you need to deposit funds, follow the [instructions provided](./intro#deposit-eth-to-your-smart-account-on-arbitrum-one) in the Telefrens interface. <!--Check out the [deposit tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmyt5i7JmBPd03r2eJ-EaMA) on YouTube.-->

:::

3. Enter the amount you wish to trade (e.g., 0.001 ETH) in the prepopulated app and set your slippage preference.

4. Confirm the transaction if the details meet your expectations.

    - You will receive a DM confirmation from the bot upon successful submission of the trade request.

    - Check the status of your trade either through the explorer link provided by the bot or in your Telefrens app smart account transaction history.
