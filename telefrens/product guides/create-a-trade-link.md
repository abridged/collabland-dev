### How do I earn money using Telefrens?

There are several key steps.
- [FAQ](#faq)
  - [How do I earn money using Telefrens?](#how-do-i-earn-money-using-telefrens)
    - [1. Create a Trade Link](#1-create-a-trade-link)
    - [2. Share the Trade Link to Others](#2-share-the-trade-link-to-others)
    - [3. Help Others Execute Your Trade Link](#3-help-others-execute-your-trade-link)

#### 1. Create a Trade Link

1. Type `/tradelink` in DMs with the Telefrens bot or use the command from the Telefrens bot menu in Telegram DMs.

2. Click on "create trade link".

3. Select a token for trading. Telefrens uses [OKX DEX](https://www.okx.com/web3/build/docs/build-dapp/api-asset-get-all-coins) on the Arbitrum blockchain and only supports those tokens currently.

4. Decide whether to restrict the trade link to your Pass Holders only.
  
    - Skip this restriction if you want the link to be open to everyone.

5. Submit your trade link.

#### 2. Share the Trade Link to Others

1. Copy the unique trade link.

2. Share this link with your contacts or in a group to enable others to trade the selected asset by opening the link.

#### 3. Help Others Execute Your Trade Link
