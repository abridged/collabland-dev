### About this app

The Snapshot app allows you to receive notifications in your DAO or communities Discord whenever a Snapshot proposal is created, and when a proposal is ending. These notifications will be posted to a Discord channel that you choose, and also include links to the Snapshot space, as well as a link directly to the proposal.

**To get started:**

1. Install the Snapshot app
2. Click on Snapshot on the left side of your screen
3. Click on the "Subscribe to a space" button
4. Enter the space name as it appears in the Snapshot url
    - Ex: <https://snapshot.org/#/example.eth>
    - In the above example, the space name would be example.eth
5. Select the Discord channel where you would like to receive notifications from the dropdown list

Once you have completed the setup, Snapshot events will now be sent to the Discord channel that you chose automatically.
