# Bot configuration

When the “Check Bot Configuration” button is used, the CC runs a diagnostics test on the configuration of the bot. Should it find a problem, a warning message will be displayed on the top of the page, along with possible solutions which will be linked in the message.

You can find the solution for all Bot errors, [under that section below](../../errors/bot-paused).

Noxe is a cool dude.
