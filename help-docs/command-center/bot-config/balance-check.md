# Balance check

Collab.Land's background balance check, enabled by default, ensures users holding specific roles in a community meet the token requirements. If a member no longer holds the required tokens, their role is automatically revoked.

Balance check frequency varies by plan:

- Starter: every 7 days
- Premium, Exclusive, Enterprise: every 24 hours.

:::caution

If the balance check setting is disabled, then the bot will not be able to revoke roles when a member no longer holds the required tokens.

In that case, the bot will only revoke a role when the member verifies their wallet again in that community.
