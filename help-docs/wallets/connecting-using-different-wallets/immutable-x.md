### Immutable X verification guide

If you have an Immutable X wallet, you can use it to verify your identity on Collab.Land. Follow these steps to verify your wallet:

<div class="text--center">
  <img  src={img1} alt="Verify with Immutable X" />
</div>

1. In an Immutable X community, go to the #collabland-join channel and click the “Let’s Go!” button.

2. Select the “+ Verify with a new wallet” option from the wallet delegation page.

3. Select the “Show All” button to show all available wallet options, and select Immutable X.

4. In the Immutable X popup, select Sign, and then sign the message with Metamask

5. Click the Sign Message button on the Collab.Land connect site

6. Verify the signature request in the Immutable X popup, and click next. Finally, sign the message in Metamask to complete the verification process.


:::note

If this is the first time you have used Immutable X, you will first need to set up an Immutable X Key.
