The Collab.Land bot only supports connecting one Discord username to a wallet address. If you receive a "duplicate wallet" alert, it means that another Discord User ID is already associated with the same public wallet address.

To quickly resolve the issue of a Duplicate Wallet, the most effective approach is to [disconnect the wallet](./disconnect-your-wallet) from all verified communities. 

Otherwise, if you want to reset the public wallet address to be associated with your username, follow these steps:

1. Go to the new wallet connection page.

2. If there is already an account associated with the wallet address, you'll see a page similar to the one shown below.

3. Click "Yes" to reset the association.

You'll receive a "Scheduled time for reset" notification, indicating that the process will take ~5 minutes to complete.
