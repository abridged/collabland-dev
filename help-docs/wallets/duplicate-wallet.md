The Collab.Land bot only supports connecting one Discord username to a wallet address. If you receive a "duplicate wallet" alert, it means that another Discord User ID is already associated with the same public wallet address.

To quickly resolve the issue of a Duplicate Wallet, the most effective approach is to [disconnect the wallet](./disconnect-your-wallet) from all verified communities. By doing so, you can avoid the 24-hour waiting period and start using the wallet with your other Discord account without delay.

Otherwise, if you want to reset the public wallet address to be associated with your username, follow these steps:

1. Go to the new wallet connection page.

2. If there is already an account associated with the wallet address, you'll see a page similar to the one shown below.

3. Click "Yes" to reset the association.

You'll receive a "Scheduled time for reset" notification, indicating that the process will take 24 hours to complete.

Please be patient while the process is underway. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to our support team for assistance.
