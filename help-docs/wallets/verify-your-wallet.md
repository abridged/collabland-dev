### Verify a new wallet in a Discord community

:::info

You can watch a [tutorial video for verifying a new wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZ0X2SGphQ&list=PLQbEq7a9kYPnufJFY8XDr5HjvPaThjoS-&index=7&t=80s) on the Collab.Land youtube channel.

To verify with a new wallet, click on the "Let's Go" button. You will be directed to a page where you will choose your wallet from the [available options](#supported-wallets).

If this is the first time you are connecting a wallet to your account, you will be required to sign a message. This signature is necessary to confirm your ownership of the wallet and ensure the security of your funds. After the first time, you can verify an already connected wallet without having to sign a message.
