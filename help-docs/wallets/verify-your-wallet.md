## Verifying for the first time

### Verify a new wallet in a Discord community

:::info

You can watch a [tutorial video for verifying a new wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZ0X2SGphQ&list=PLQbEq7a9kYPnufJFY8XDr5HjvPaThjoS-&index=7&t=80s) on the Collab.Land youtube channel.

</div>

To verify with a new wallet, click on the "Let's Go" button. You will be directed to a page where you will choose your wallet from the [available options](#supported-wallets).

If this is the first time you are connecting a wallet to your account, you will be required to sign a message. This signature is necessary to confirm your ownership of the wallet and ensure the security of your funds. After the first time, you can verify an already connected wallet without having to sign a message.

### Verify a new wallet in a Telegram group

See how you can [join a Telegram group](/help-docs/FAQ/join-tg-group#how-to-join-a-collabland-managed-telegram-group) managed by Collab.Land.

## Verify with an existing wallet

You can watch a [tutorial video for verifying an existing wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZ0X2SGphQ&list=PLQbEq7a9kYPnufJFY8XDr5HjvPaThjoS-&index=7&t=42s) on the Collab.Land youtube channel.

Verifying with a new different wallet is an option for members who hold their tokens in more than wallet. If you are interested in verifying with a new wallet, simply click on the "Let's Go" button, and you will be directed to a page where you can choose to verify with any of the previously connected wallets.

## Supported Wallets

This wallet list is intended for community members. It shows which wallets can be used with which blockchains.

Admins should reference the [list of supported blockchains](/help-docs/key-features/token-gate-communities#supported-blockchains--tokens) and corresponding Token Types while [creating TGRs](/help-docs/command-center/create-a-tgr/how-to-create-a-tgr) for their community.
