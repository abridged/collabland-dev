# SmartTag

Send, receive, withdraw tokens, and more - fully onchain, right inside your community. Just tag a username. Smart accounts + Discord login = simple, secure, seamless.

SmartTag is available exclusively to **Collab.Land Exclusive plan subscribers**.
See all Exclusive plan features [here](https://collab.land/pricing).


### Innovations:

* **Smart Accounts for Everyone**
  No external wallets or seed phrases - each Discord member automatically gets a smart account.

* **Transparent Transactions**
  Fully onchain, efficient, and secure.

* **Integrated Fees**
  Use the tipping token itself to cover gas. No second token needed.

* **Frictionless Interactions**
  Tag a username or User ID - no wallet address required.


## Benefits of SmartTag

* **Onchain Activity Boost**
  All activity is visible on public block explorers, increasing token visibility and transaction volume.

* **Multi-Community Support**
  Once a token is added, it‚Äôs usable across all Collab.Land Exclusive communities.

* **Member Engagement**
  Welcome, reward, recognize, or pay members with tokens. Even trade between members.

* **Contests and Competitions**
  Distribute rewards for games, giveaways, tournaments, and more.

* **Admin Rewards**
  Admins with the `TagMaster` role can set a wallet to receive **2% of transaction fees**. This role is:

  * Assigned automatically to whoever installs the SmartTag miniapp
  * Assignable to others manually in Discord

:::caution
The designated fee wallet must be on the same chain as the community‚Äôs configured chain.

## What's a Smart Account?

A Smart Account is a type of Web3 programmable wallet driven by smart contracts, eliminating the need for private keys or seed phrases. These accounts use code for security and recovery of wallet information.

:::info
Your Smart Account wallet will hold the tokens received from in-chat transactions and deposits.
:::

## How to Get Started

1. Be on the **Exclusive plan** or higher
2. Add the SmartTag miniapp to your Discord server
3. That‚Äôs it! Members can start using SmartTag commands immediately

:::caution
Installing SmartTag creates a `TagMaster` role and assigns it to you.
Ensure the **Collab.Land** role is positioned **above** the roles of anyone receiving the SmartTag role, otherwise it will fail.

## üåßÔ∏è Mass Token Drops: The `/tag raindrops` Command

Raindrops let you distribute tokens to multiple members at once.
Create a timed reward pool with a cap on participants.

### Here's how it works:

* You define the:

  * Total amount of tokens
  * Claim duration
  * Max number of participants
* Each person gets an equal share, even if fewer people claim.
* Unclaimed tokens are returned to you.


### How to Start a Raindrop on Discord

1. **Check your balance**
   Use `/tag balance` or `/tag deposit` to ensure you have enough tokens.

2. **Create the drop**

```
/tag raindrops [amount] [token] [duration] [max participants]
```

**Example:**

```
/tag raindrops 100 COLLAB 10m 33
```

* Sends 100 \$COLLAB to up to 33 members
* Open for 10 minutes
* Each gets \~3.03 tokens if all slots are filled
* Leftovers return to your Smart Account
