## Why use it?

The primary goal of the Marketplace is to empower community administrators to unlock the full potential of their communities. With an extensive collection of apps available, administrators can add new capabilities and features that were previously unavailable.
With a few clicks, administrators can ensure that their communities always have access to the latest features and functionalities. This means that the community will stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technology, providing the members an exceptional user experience and staying ahead of the curve.
