## Subscription Plans

Beginning **November 12, 2025**, Collab.Land plans are based on **Verified Members** - a model that aligns pricing with actual community usage instead of Token Gated Roles (TGRs).  

This shift keeps pricing clear, predictable, and fair for every type of community: big, small, new, OG, NFT, DAO, or builder. Your plan now scales with the real people Collab.Land is working for: verified, active holders.

### What’s Changing

- **From TGRs to Verified Members:**  
  Verified Members are the unique people in your community who successfully pass Collab.Land verification and hold at least one token gated role created through Collab.Land. These are the members whose ownership is routinely checked to confirm they still qualify to keep their roles or access private chats and channels.

- **Simpler and Fairer:**  
  This usage-based model aligns plans with real activity, rewards efficient setups, and makes scaling more transparent.

- **24-hour Balance Checks for Everyone:**  
  All plans, including Starter, now include daily automated ownership checks ensuring your roles and gated spaces always stay accurate and secure.

### Grace Period for Existing Communities

All new communities are automatically on the Verified Members model as of **November 12, 2025**.  
Existing communities have a **grace period until December 1, 2025** to review their usage and move into the plan that best fits, or stay where they are if their current plan already aligns with their Verified Member count.

During this period, your plan continues operating as before. No changes or disruptions occur automatically.

### What Happens if You’re Over Your Verified Member Limit

If your Verified Member count exceeds your plan’s limit, Collab.Land continues working normally for members within that limit.  
Members above the limit will appear as **Pending** and won’t complete verification until you either upgrade or come back within range.

Example:  
If you’re on **Starter (up to 25 Verified Members)** but have 50 Verified Members, Collab.Land supports 25 and holds the rest as Pending until you upgrade to **Basic**.

Pending members act as your real-time signal that it’s time to level up.

### How to Check Your Usage

Visit your community’s **TGR & Plan Usage** section in the [Command Center](https://cc.collab.land) to see:

- Verified Members (active users Collab.Land maintains)  
- Pending Members (new verifications waiting due to plan limits)

If you’re seeing pending members, it’s a sign your community is growing. Adjust your plan anytime to match your Verified Member count.

**Staking Contract Support lets communities use staking contracts already integrated with Collab.Land at no additional cost beyond their plan. Adding a new staking contract requires a custom integration and incurs an additional fee. [To request one, review the process and requirements here.](https://github.com/abridged/collabland-staking-contracts/blob/master/README.md)
