## Community Tipping

Collab.Land's tipping system enables members in Discord communities to express appreciation and support by tipping **$COLLAB** tokens on the **Optimism** chain. Transactions are executed through Smart Accounts, ensuring security and efficiency. This decentralized tipping system enhances community engagement by providing a user-friendly and secure way to interact and support fellow community members within Discord.

:::note
To refill tips in your Smart Account, ONLY deposit $COLLAB on OP. Do not send other tokens!
They cannot be retrieved at this time.

## What's a Smart Account?

A Smart Account is a type of Web3 programmable wallet driven by smart contracts, eliminating the need for private keys or seed phrases. These accounts use code for security and recovery of wallet information.

:::note
Your Smart Account wallet will hold the $COLLAB tokens received from tips and deposits.

## How to Get Started

After logging into Discord, you can activate your Smart Account within the [Collab.Land Discord Server](https://discord.gg/collabland) by using any /tip command.

Once activated, you can start tipping other members by using the `/tip to` command, specifying the recipient `{@username}` and the desired `{amount}` of $COLLAB tokens you wish to send to them.

:::caution
Tips are onchain transactions.
Always verify that you are tipping the right person! If a tip goes to the wrong place, the transaction CANNOT be reverted or canceled.
