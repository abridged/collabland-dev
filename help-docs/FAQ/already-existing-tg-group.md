If you're planning to add the Collab.Land bot to an already existing Telegram group—especially one that's either not currently token-gated or using a different bot—please read this carefully to avoid unintended disruptions.

### Recommended: Create a New Group
To ensure a smooth transition and protect your member experience, we strongly recommend **creating a new Telegram group** and inviting the Collab.Land bot from the start. Once your new group is ready, you can:
- Post the Collab.Land invite link (available in your Command Center) in your current group
- Also share the invite link on your socials to make sure all current and future members know where to go
- Notify members about the move and when the new group will become the primary chat 

This approach maintains your community's integrity and gives everyone a clear path to rejoin using Collab.Land's verification process.


### What Happens If You Add Collab.Land Bot to an Existing Group
If you add Collab.Land directly to an existing group instead:
- The bot will monitor messages. When a member chats, Collab.Land will:
  - ✅ Allow them to stay if they've already connected to Collab.Land and qualify
  - ❌ Kick them if they've never connected to Collab.Land
  - ❌ Kick them if they've connected but no longer qualify
- Members who do not chat will remain in the group—meaning unverified or ineligible users could still be present until they speak.

**TL;DR:**

> To preserve your community structure and avoid surprise kicks:
> - Create a new group, invite the Collab.Land bot, and share the invite link in your old group and on socials with clear migration instructions.
> - You'll find your unique invite link in the Command Center under the group's setup page.
