# Security & Privacy

As you explore the world of crypto, it is a good general practice to exercise caution. A member of Collab.Land support will never contact you first nor will they ask for your private key or seed phrase.

## What does the Collab.Land bot access when I connect with my wallet?

When connecting with the Collab.Land bot READ ONLY access is given to verify a wallet’s token holding that is publicly available on the blockchain. This does not give Collab.Land access to your funds or power to act on your behalf.
