A look at what joining a Collab.Land-managed Telegram group looks like and how it works. If the flow is different, it's an impersonator bot!

The true Collab.Land bot is named `@collablandbot`.

</div>

:::danger

Make sure you are interacting with the correct bot `@collablandbot`. There are many imposters with similar names.

:::

You will be asked to connect your wallet to the bot so it can verify you are the owner of that wallet.

For best results:
- Use the Telegram desktop app to verify your wallets
- Use a wallet that Collab.Land supports. Here's the list of [Collab.Land-supported wallets](/key-features/supported-blockchains-wallets#supported-wallets)

## How to Join a Collab.Land-managed Telegram group

1. Verify you received a legitimate invite link from `@collablandbot`.

   - Your admin will share the invite will be a link in the format telegram.me/**collablandbot**?start=ABCD1234...
   - If the link is not _**exactly**_ `collablandbot`, it is an imposter.

2. Use the invite link generated by the bot.  

3. Click the `START` button

4. Verify the `Community:` field is correct for the community you are trying to join.

</div>

:::caution

You must complete the wallet verification process within 5 minutes or you will get an error. To resolve the error, start again from the "Connect Wallet" button in Telegram.

:::

    - You can connect previously connected wallets instead by using the "Use Connected Wallets" button.

</div>

6. In your browser popup, select a wallet from the list of [Collab.Land-support wallets](/key-features/supported-blockchains-wallets#supported-wallets) to verify.

</div>

7. Follow the instructions to have your wallet sign the connection request from the bot.

   - This signature is necessary to confirm your ownership of the wallet and ensure the security of your funds.
   - After the first time, you can verify an already connected wallet without having to sign a message by selecting the "Use Connected Wallets" button.
   - When the wallet is successfully linked, a wallet connected message will appear in the browser window. Return to Telegram to proceed.
