A look at what joining a Collab.Land-managed Telegram group looks like and how it works. If the flow is different, it's an impersonator bot!

Make sure you are interacting with the correct bot `@collablandbot`. There are many imposters with similar names.

You will be asked to connect your wallet to the bot so it can verify you are the owner of that wallet.

For best results:
- Use the Telegram desktop app to verify your wallets
- Use a wallet that Collab.Land supports. Here's the list of [Collab.Land-supported wallets](/help-docs/wallets/verify-your-wallet#supported-wallets)
