## About Collab.Land

### How did Collab.Land start?

Collab.Land has its roots as the Collab-19 bot, a submission to the ETH-Money hackathon in May of 2020 in response to Covid-19. Using ERC20 tokens, the Collab-19 bot managed access to a gated Telegram channel. In October of 2020 Collab.Land had grown to also support Discord. As of today, Collab.Land has over 47k registered communities.

### What is the Collab.Land bot?

The Collab.Land bot is an automated community management tool that curates membership based on token ownership. We begin with initial verification, confirming that each prospective member possesses the required token(s) to join and participate in your community, and follow up with routine checks to confirm members continuously satisfy your requirements.
