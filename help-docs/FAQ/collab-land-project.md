## About Collab.Land

### How did Collab.Land start?

Collab.Land has its roots as the Collab-19 bot, a submission to the ETH-Money hackathon in May of 2020 in response to Covid-19. Using ERC20 tokens, the Collab-19 bot managed access to a gated Telegram channel. In October of 2020 Collab.Land had grown to also support Discord. As of today, Collab.Land has over 47k registered communities.

### What is the Collab.Land bot?

The Collab.Land bot is an automated community management tool that curates membership based on token ownership. We begin with initial verification, confirming that each prospective member possesses the required token(s) to join and participate in your community, and follow up with routine checks to confirm members continuously satisfy your requirements.

## The future of Collab.Land

### What is next for Collab.Land?

As Collab.Land grew, the team understood that ‚Äútoken gating‚Äù was here to stay and that there would be competition. Instead of the typical startup path of raising more venture money which would lead to monetizing user data, the team decided to think BIG.

Instead of a competitive feature race, Collab.Land decided to transform itself in to a distribution platform for web3 social apps. Similar to Facebook‚Äôs transformation by opening up to 3rd party developers, Collab.Land has done the same but using a DAO instead of centralizing control.

This has turned Collab.Land in to the premiere distribution platform for web3 developers owned by the users of the network. The Collab.Land Marketplace is the best way developers, brands and advertisers can reach tokenized communities

### What is the Collab.Land Marketplace?

The [Collab.Land Marketplace](https://collabland.mirror.xyz/1CpoxkVSzkCrIJ6vkTqqvD9xmLyiWEyng6gAXDtFB7g) is for third-party developers to build Miniapps that extend our core software. Community Members, Admins, and Developers will all benefit from this collaboration.

In the Marketplace, Developers will publish their own integrations with core Collab.Land software. Put Miniapps exactly where they‚Äôre wanted, in front of the communities that will benefit from them!

Admins will customize their communities by installing Miniapps from the Marketplace. Community Members and Admins together curate the offerings in the Marketplace by reviewing Miniapps and surfacing high quality ones!

We all protect the Collab.Land network by building and curating the Miniapp Marketplace.
