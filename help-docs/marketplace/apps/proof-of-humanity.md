### About this app

Rarimo’s Proof-of-Humanity plug-in ensures that only verified humans are present either within a server or channel. It keeps the community server spam and scam free which saves mods’ time, improves the quality of conversation, and helps protect airdrops.

The solution is uniquely robust, yet does not require users to reveal any personal details. Users can select between five identity providers to verify their humanity, and will receive a verifed human credential that they can use across Web3 for perks and exclusive access.

### Getting Started

To get started:

1. Install the Proof of Humanity Miniapp from the [Collab.Land Marketplace](https://cc.collab.land/).
1. Create a discord role for verified humans.
1. Create a following token-gating rule in the Command Center:

    | Field  | Value |
    |---|---|
    |Chain|`Polygon`|
    |Token Type|`ERC721`|
    |Addresses|`0xaD7De01cb7eaAFf3a419A0a0a3133a964cD90373`|

1. Create a role-exclusive channel for verified humans.
1. Ask users to verify their humanity using the `/verify` command, ideally in the `#collabland-join` channel.

<!-- TODO: replace with the prod link once the miniapp is live -->
