# CollabLand-Connect

## Check out source code from git

```bash
git clone git@github.com:abridged/collabland-connect.git
```

## Set up Node.js and Yarn

1. Install `nvm`

   Please follow instructions at
   <https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating> to install `nvm` so
   that we can easily switch between different node versions.

2. Install `node`

   With `nvm`, let's install Node.js 14 as the default version:

   ```sh
   nvm install 14.18.1
   ```

3. install yarn

   ```sh
   npm install -g yarn
   ```

4. Verify `node` and `yarn`

   You can use the command below to verify that Node.js 14.x and Yarn 1.22.x are
   installed.

   ```sh
   node -v
   yarn -v
   ```

   It should print the version of `node` (such as `v14.x.x`) and `yarn` (such as
   `1.22.17`).

## Apple M1 Dependency
This repo has a hard dependency of node version 14. Due to certain dependencies it doesn't work on node version 16. And the native support for M1 apple silicon hardware came natively into node 16 only. So when we try do `yarn install` with node 16 the **wrtc** package fails to compile (an internal dependency). So we will need to install rosetta and do this install with that. Please follow this link [M1 issues with node version](https://dev.to/ibrarturi/how-to-fix-m1-mac-issue-with-installing-node-versions-30ah).

Use Node version **`14.18.1`**

## Setting Up Environment Variables
Set the api server url in the environment variable of wallet connect repo. Also one need to create account on [Infura](https://infura.io/) and get API key from there which needs to be setup as part of env variable on this repo.

start-react.sh

```bash
#REACT_APP_BITSKI_CLIENT_ID=
REACT_APP_IS_DEBUG=false
REACT_APP_INFURA_ID=1a28be2ff97d45hj8145e1ll4c1fghj7
REACT_APP_API_SERVER_URL=https://collabland-calebgates.loca.lt
export PORT=3001

npm run start
```


If all good then wallet connection UI will come up but with one error which is just on local and can be ignored.

![Wallet Error](imgs/wallet-error.png)

Just cross this error and main UI will load.


## Possible errors & solutions in building the project:

- missing node-pre-gyp
- Memory Limitations when building collab-connect
- Arm vs Intel OS architecture (M1 specific issue)
- AWS Amplify deployment issue


```bash
git clone git@github.com:abridged/collabland-connect.git
cd collabland-connect

```

### Error 1

```bash
## Got an error for not having "node-pre-gyp"
npm install -g node-pre-gyp
npm install

npm run build
```

### Error 2

Failing to build - ram error? Using mac with only 8 gigs of ram (thank goodness for M1 Max 64gb Ram)

To fix this error, you need to update the maximum heap size in node using the following cmd:

```jsx
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192"
```

```jsx
node -e 'console.log(v8.getHeapStatistics().heap_size_limit/(1024*1024))'
```
